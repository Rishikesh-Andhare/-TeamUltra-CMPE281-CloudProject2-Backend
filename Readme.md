Problem Statement :- 
SJSU Bus service: The online college bus transportation service is a solution aimed at improving the current transportation system for college students and staff. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and convenience of the transportation system by allowing users to book and manage their bus rides, view bus schedules and routes, and receive real-time updates on the status of the buses. This service will help reduce wait times, minimize transportation-related issues, and increase overall satisfaction with the college transportation system. The implementation of this service will involve designing a user-friendly online platform that integrates with the existing transportation system, and implementing necessary technology and infrastructure to support real-time updates and monitoring. The ultimate aim is to provide a seamless and efficient transportation experience for college students and staff.
Project Description :-
The main objective of the Bus Pass web-application system is to provide a convenient and efficient way for college students and professors to access information related to their bus passes. The system is designed to be cloud-based, which makes it easier for users to purchase bus passes online, saving time and effort compared to traditional methods of obtaining a bus pass. The application will provide a secure and user-friendly platform for users to create an account, manage their bus pass transactions, and retrieve information about their bus passes. The online portal will also help resolve issues related to lost or misplaced bus passes by providing an accurate record of passenger information. The system will allow users to purchase tickets for themselves and their friends or family members, and manage their accounts online. The application will be secure, reliable, affordable, effective, and efficient, and will automatically renew the user's bus pass when it is due for renewal, without requiring additional time and effort from the user. Overall, the Bus Pass web-application system is designed to provide a seamless and convenient experience for college students and professors, saving them time and effort while ensuring the safety and security of their bus pass information.

  Development process :-
The project will use : -
1) Django Rest API Framework (Backend)
2) ReactJS (FrontEnd)
3) AWS Services
Our project leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies to provide a robust and scalable solution for the Bus Pass web-application system. At the backend, we are using Django Rest API Framework, which is a high-level Python web framework that makes it easy to build RESTful APIs. The Django Rest API Framework provides a clean and organized way of handling requests and responses, making it simple to implement complex logic and handle multiple users simultaneously. Additionally, it is equipped with features such as authentication, security, and database management, making it a suitable choice for our project's backend.
For the frontend, we are using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS provides a flexible and efficient way of building dynamic and interactive web pages, making it a great choice for our project's frontend. The library's component-based architecture makes it easy to break down complex user interfaces into smaller, reusable components, and its virtual DOM ensures fast and efficient updates to the user interface.
Furthermore, we are utilizing various Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide the necessary infrastructure and services for our project. AWS offers a wide range of cloud-based services, such as computing, storage, and networking, which allows us to easily scale and manage our project as it grows. By leveraging AWS, we can ensure the reliability, security, and availability of our system, even during periods of high traffic and demand.
In summary, our project is built using Django Rest API Framework for the backend, ReactJS for the frontend, and various AWS services for the infrastructure and services, making it a robust, scalable, and secure solution for the Bus Pass web-application system.
